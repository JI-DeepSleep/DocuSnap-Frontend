# Key Business Processes

In addition to document scanning and form field extraction, DocuSnap-Frontend includes several other key business processes. This page describes these important workflows in detail.

## User Authentication Process

DocuSnap-Frontend supports optional PIN code protection to ensure the security of sensitive documents:

### PIN Code Setup

1. User enables PIN code protection in the settings
2. PIN code is hashed and stored in secure storage
3. Biometric authentication can be enabled as an option
4. Security settings are saved with user preferences

### Application Launch Authentication

1. Application checks if PIN code protection is enabled at startup
2. If enabled, navigation redirects to `PinVerificationScreen`
3. User enters PIN code or uses biometric authentication
4. After successful verification, navigation proceeds to the main screen
5. Failed attempts may implement increasing delays or lockouts

### Authentication Timeout

1. Application automatically locks after a certain period in the background
2. Returning to the application requires re-verification
3. Timeout duration can be configured in settings
4. Critical operations may require re-authentication regardless of timeout

## Document Search and Filtering Process

The application provides powerful search and filtering capabilities:

### Search Initialization

1. User taps the search icon or navigates to the search screen
2. `SearchScreen` initializes, displaying recent searches and popular items
3. Search interface provides filtering options and suggestions
4. Recent searches are loaded from local storage

### Search Execution

1. User enters search keywords
2. `SearchViewModel` calls Repository to execute the search
3. Repository searches the local database for matches
4. Search covers document names, descriptions, tags, and extracted text
5. Results are ranked by relevance and recency

### Result Filtering

1. User can apply filters (such as date range, document type)
2. Filtered results update in real-time
3. Results are sorted by relevance or recent usage
4. Filter combinations can be saved as presets

### Search Result Handling

1. User taps a result item to navigate to the corresponding detail page
2. Search history is updated
3. Search statistics are collected to improve search algorithms
4. Frequently searched terms may be suggested in future searches

## Form Editing and Update Process

Form editing is an interactive process involving collaboration between the user and automated extraction results:

### Form Loading

1. User selects a form from the form library
2. `FormDetailScreen` loads form data and extracted fields
3. Form images and field list are displayed
4. Field extraction confidence levels are indicated visually

### Field Editing

1. User can edit field values, add new fields, or delete fields
2. Editing is performed through the `ExtractedInfoItem` component
3. Changes are saved to the in-memory form object in real-time
4. Auto-save functionality may be enabled to prevent data loss

### Field Validation

1. Some fields may have validation rules (such as date format, number range)
2. Validation errors are displayed to the user with correction suggestions
3. Form cannot be saved until validation passes
4. Field types may have specific input methods (date picker, number input, etc.)

### Form Update

1. User saves the form after completing edits
2. ViewModel calls Repository to update the database
3. Updated form can be exported or shared
4. Form usage statistics are updated

## Document Export and Sharing Process

DocuSnap-Frontend provides secure methods for exporting and sharing documents:

### Export Preparation

1. User selects export option from document or form detail screen
2. Export format options are presented (PDF, JSON, CSV, etc.)
3. User selects desired format and export options
4. Export preview may be shown for confirmation

### Export Execution

1. Document or form data is formatted according to selected export format
2. For secure formats, encryption options may be presented
3. Export process executes, generating the output file
4. Progress is displayed for large documents or forms

### Sharing

1. After export, sharing options are presented
2. Standard Android sharing dialog allows sending to other apps
3. Direct sharing to common destinations may be featured
4. Sharing history may be tracked for frequently used destinations

### Export Security

1. Exported documents can be password-protected
2. Sensitive data can be redacted before export
3. Watermarks or metadata can be added for tracking
4. Export logs maintain records of what was shared and when

## Data Synchronization Process

For users with multiple devices or cloud backup needs, DocuSnap-Frontend implements data synchronization:

### Sync Configuration

1. User enables synchronization in settings
2. Authentication with sync service is performed
3. Sync preferences (what to sync, frequency, etc.) are configured
4. Initial sync status is displayed

### Automatic Synchronization

1. Changes to documents or forms trigger sync events
2. Sync service queues changes for upload
3. Background sync occurs based on configured conditions (Wi-Fi only, charging, etc.)
4. Conflict resolution policies are applied for simultaneous edits

### Manual Synchronization

1. User can trigger manual sync from settings
2. Sync progress is displayed with detailed status
3. Errors are reported with retry options
4. Sync history shows recent successful and failed syncs

### Offline Operation

1. All core functions work offline
2. Changes are queued for sync when connectivity returns
3. Sync status indicators show pending changes
4. Critical operations may warn if they haven't been synced

These key business processes demonstrate how DocuSnap-Frontend handles complex user interactions and data management requirements, providing a comprehensive document and form management solution.
