# Form Processing Module

## Responsibilities

The Form Processing module focuses on form capture, field extraction, and management, which is another core functional module of the application. Its main responsibilities include:

- Form data model definition and management
- Automatic recognition and extraction of form fields
- Form creation, reading, updating, and deletion operations
- Form field editing and validation
- Form template management
- Form data export and sharing

## Interface Design

### Main Classes and Interfaces

#### 1. Form Data Model

Defines the data structure and fields of a form.

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class Form(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val description: String,
    val imageBase64s: List<String> = emptyList(),
    val formFields: List<FormField> = emptyList(),
    val extractedInfo: List<ExtractedInfoItem> = emptyList(),
    val tags: List<String> = emptyList(),
    val uploadDate: String = "2024-01-15",
    val relatedFileIds: List<String> = emptyList(),
    val sha256: String? = null,
    val isProcessed: Boolean = false,
    val jobId: Long? = null,
    val usageCount: Int = 0,
    val lastUsed: String = "2024-01-15"
)
```

#### 2. Form Field Model

Represents a single field in a form.

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class FormField(
    val name: String,
    val value: String? = null,
    val isRetrieved: Boolean = false,
    val srcFileId: String? = null
)
```

#### 3. FormDao

Provides interface for form database operations, supporting form search and filtering.

```kotlin
@Dao
interface FormDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM forms ORDER BY last_used DESC")
    fun getAll(): Flow<List<FormEntity>>
    
    @Query("SELECT * FROM forms WHERE id = :id")
    suspend fun getById(id: String): FormEntity?
    
    @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE)
    suspend fun insert(form: FormEntity)
    
    @Update
    suspend fun update(form: FormEntity)
    
    @Delete
    suspend fun delete(form: FormEntity)
    
    @Query("SELECT * FROM forms WHERE name LIKE '%' || :query || '%' OR description LIKE '%' || :query || '%'")
    fun search(query: String): Flow<List<FormEntity>>
}
```

## Design Patterns and Extension Points

### Design Patterns

#### 1. Data Mapping Pattern
- Converts between entities and models
- Separates persistence logic from business logic

#### 2. Strategy Pattern
- Different field extraction strategies can be interchanged
- Supports processing of different form types

#### 3. Observer Pattern
- Uses Flow to implement reactive data flow
- Automatically updates UI in response to data changes

### Extension Points

#### 1. Custom Form Templates
- Form templates can be defined and applied
- Supports specialized templates for different industries and scenarios

#### 2. Field Validation Rules
- Field validation logic can be extended
- Supports custom validation rules and error messages

#### 3. Form Data Export Formats
- Can be extended to multiple export formats
- Supports integration with other systems

#### 4. Intelligent Field Matching
- Field recognition algorithms can be extended
- Supports machine learning-based field recognition

## Form Processing Workflow

The form processing workflow involves several steps:

1. **Form Capture**: User captures form images using the camera or selects from the media library
2. **Image Processing**: Images are processed to enhance quality and readability
3. **Field Extraction**: Form is sent to the backend for field extraction
4. **User Verification**: User reviews and edits extracted fields
5. **Form Storage**: Completed form is stored in the local database
6. **Form Usage**: Form data can be exported, shared, or used in other applications

This workflow combines automated processing with user interaction to provide an efficient and accurate form data capture and management solution.
