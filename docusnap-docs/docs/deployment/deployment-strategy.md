# Deployment Strategy and Security Considerations

This page details the deployment strategy, security measures, and update mechanisms implemented in DocuSnap-Frontend.

## Build and Release Process

DocuSnap-Frontend follows a standard Android application build and release process:

### 1. Version Management

- **Version Number**: 1.1.2 (versionName)
- **Build Number**: 4 (versionCode)
- Version numbers are incremented with each release
- Semantic versioning is followed (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

### 2. Build Configuration

- **Compile SDK Version**: 35
- **Minimum SDK Version**: 33 (Android 13)
- **Target SDK Version**: 35
- **Java Compatibility Version**: Java 11
- **Build Types**:
  - Debug: Used during development with debugging enabled
  - Release: Optimized for distribution with debugging disabled

### 3. Release Channels

- Primary distribution through Google Play Store
- Support for internal testing and staged releases
- Enterprise distribution channels available
- Alpha and beta testing programs for early feedback

### 4. Update Strategy

- In-app update notifications
- Regular feature updates and security patches
- Forced update mechanism for critical security fixes
- Phased rollouts for major updates

## Data Encryption and Secure Communication

DocuSnap-Frontend implements multiple layers of security to protect user data:

### 1. Transport Encryption

- **HTTPS Communication**: All network traffic uses secure HTTPS
- **RSA Public Key Encryption**: 2048-bit keys
- **AES-CBC Symmetric Encryption**: 256-bit keys
- **Encryption Modes**:
  - RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding
  - AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding

Example of the hybrid encryption implementation:

```kotlin
// Generate AES key
val aesKey = cryptoUtil.generateAesKey()
val encryptedContent = cryptoUtil.aesEncrypt(innerJson.toString().toByteArray(), aesKey)
val sha256 = cryptoUtil.computeSHA256(encryptedContent)
val encryptedAesKey = cryptoUtil.rsaEncrypt(aesKey, cryptoUtil.getPublicKey(settingsManager.getPublicKeyPem()))
```

### 2. Data Integrity

- **SHA-256 Hash Verification**: Ensures data hasn't been tampered with
- **Digital Signature Verification**: Validates data source
- **Tamper-proof Mechanisms**: Detects unauthorized modifications

### 3. Local Security

- Sensitive data is encrypted before local storage
- Android KeyStore system protects encryption keys
- Secure export mechanisms for data sharing

## PIN Code Protection and Local Security

DocuSnap-Frontend provides additional local security mechanisms:

### 1. PIN Code Protection

- Optional application PIN code protection
- PIN codes are hashed before storage
- Support for biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition)
- Configurable security timeout

### 2. Session Management

- Application automatically locks after a period of inactivity
- Configurable session timeout duration
- Data protection when switching applications
- Re-authentication required for sensitive operations

### 3. Permission Management

- Follows the principle of least privilege
- Runtime permission requests with clear explanations
- Permissions are requested only when needed
- Users can revoke permissions at any time

### 4. Data Isolation

- Application uses private storage
- Content provider access control
- Sandbox execution environment
- No unnecessary data sharing with other applications

## Deployment Optimization

The deployment strategy includes several optimizations:

### 1. Application Size Optimization

- Resource compression
- Image optimization
- Unused resource removal
- Language-specific resource packaging

### 2. Performance Optimization

- Startup time optimization
- Memory usage optimization
- Battery usage optimization
- Network usage optimization

### 3. Compatibility Optimization

- Device-specific optimizations
- Screen size adaptations
- Hardware feature detection
- Graceful degradation for missing features

## Continuous Integration and Delivery

While not currently implemented, the following CI/CD improvements are recommended:

### 1. Automated Building

- Implement automated builds for each commit
- Run unit tests as part of the build process
- Generate build artifacts automatically

### 2. Automated Testing

- Run automated UI tests
- Perform integration testing
- Execute performance testing

### 3. Automated Deployment

- Automate deployment to test environments
- Streamline Play Store submission
- Automate release notes generation

## Security Recommendations

Based on the current implementation, the following security enhancements are recommended:

### 1. Enable Code Obfuscation

- Enable R8 with full obfuscation
- Implement ProGuard rules to protect sensitive code
- Obfuscate class names, method names, and field names

### 2. Implement Certificate Pinning

- Add SSL certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks
- Verify server certificates against known good certificates
- Implement certificate rotation strategy

### 3. Enhance Secure Storage

- Use EncryptedSharedPreferences for all sensitive data
- Implement secure backup mechanisms
- Add additional encryption layers for highly sensitive data

### 4. Security Monitoring

- Implement runtime security checks
- Add tamper detection mechanisms
- Monitor for suspicious activities

These security measures and deployment strategies ensure that DocuSnap-Frontend is deployed in a secure, efficient manner that protects user data while providing a smooth user experience.
