# Production Environment Deployment Topology

The deployment architecture of DocuSnap-Frontend involves multiple components and environments, from development to end-user devices. The following diagram illustrates the complete deployment topology:

![Deployment Topology](../images/deployment_topology.png)

## Development Environment

The development environment includes the following components:

### 1. Source Code Repository

- GitHub hosts the source code
- Supports version control and collaborative development
- Includes branch strategy and code review process

### 2. Development Tools

- Android Studio: Primary IDE
- Gradle: Build system
- Kotlin compiler: Code compilation

### 3. Development Process

- Local development and testing
- Code commits and reviews
- Continuous integration builds

## Build Process

The build process includes the following steps:

### 1. Code Compilation

- Kotlin source code is compiled to bytecode
- Resource files are processed and optimized

### 2. Code Optimization

- R8 code optimization (currently not enabled)
- Resource compression and obfuscation

### 3. Build Types

- Debug build: Used for development and testing
- Release build: Used for distribution

### 4. Build Artifacts

- APK file: Directly installable application package
- App Bundle (AAB) not currently configured

## Deployment Targets

The application's deployment targets include:

### 1. Test Devices

- Development testing environment
- Internal testing and QA

### 2. App Stores

- Google Play Store
- Other third-party app stores

### 3. User Devices

- End users' Android devices
- Requires Android 13 (API 33) or higher

## External Services

The application depends on external services including:

### 1. Backend Server

- Provides API services
- Processes document and form data
- Performs OCR and field extraction

### 2. Cloud Storage

- Stores processing results and user data
- Supports data backup and synchronization

## Deployment Workflow

The typical deployment workflow follows these steps:

1. **Development**: Developers write and test code locally
2. **Code Review**: Changes undergo peer review
3. **Integration**: Approved changes are merged into the main branch
4. **Building**: CI system builds the application
5. **Testing**: Automated and manual testing is performed
6. **Release Preparation**: Version numbers are updated, release notes are prepared
7. **Distribution**: Application is uploaded to app stores
8. **Approval**: App store review process
9. **Release**: Application is made available to users
10. **Monitoring**: Application performance and issues are monitored

## Scaling Considerations

The application architecture considers the following scaling aspects:

### 1. User Base Scaling

- Local processing reduces backend load
- Efficient data synchronization minimizes network traffic
- Background processing optimizes user experience

### 2. Feature Scaling

- Modular architecture supports feature additions
- Clear interfaces between components
- Separation of concerns facilitates parallel development

### 3. Performance Scaling

- Image processing optimizations for different device capabilities
- Adaptive resource usage based on device specifications
- Configurable quality settings for different use cases

## Deployment Security

The deployment process includes several security measures:

### 1. Code Signing

- Application is signed with developer's key
- Signature verification ensures integrity

### 2. Distribution Security

- App stores provide additional security verification
- Safe distribution channels reduce risk of tampering

### 3. Runtime Security

- Application operates in Android's sandbox environment
- Permissions are requested at runtime
- Sensitive operations require user confirmation

This deployment topology ensures that DocuSnap-Frontend is developed, built, and distributed in a secure and efficient manner, providing a reliable application to end users.
